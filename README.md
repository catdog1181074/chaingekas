# üßæ Chainge-to-CEX Kaspa Flow Analysis

This repository investigates how much native Kaspa (KAS) Chainge Finance likely controlled ‚Äî and how much it transferred to centralized exchanges (CEXes), presumably for liquidation. The analysis is based on transaction-level tracing on the Kaspa blockchain using the [KrcBot public API](https://krcbot.com/api-docs).

## ‚ùì Why This Matters

Since late 2024, Chainge Finance has frozen the **wKAS ‚Üí KAS bridge**, initially citing security concerns, then liquidity issues, and later claiming its vaults had been blacklisted. DJ Qian, the founder, promised intervention and a "liquidity injection," but as of mid-2025, many users‚Äô funds remain trapped in wKAS.

Despite repeated claims that the bridge will reopen, no clear reserve proof or redemption pathway has been provided.

This raises a critical question:

> **Does Chainge still hold enough native KAS to back wKAS 1:1 ‚Äî or has that KAS been sold?**

This repository traces the flow of native KAS from known Chainge wallets to known CEX deposit addresses.

## üß† Methodology Summary

### Step 1: Recursive Wallet Tracing

We begin with **5 labelled Chainge wallets**, including:
- üü© The Chainge Finance Root wallet (kaspa:qqwvnkp47wsj6n4hkdlgj8dsauyx0xvefunnwvvsmpq2udd0ka8ckmpuqw3k5)  
- üü© 3 labeled Chainge wallets on kas.fyi (kaspa:qpgmt2dn8wcqf0436n0kueap7yx82n7raurlj6aqjc3t3wm9y5ssqtg9e4lsm, kaspa:qpy03sxk3z22pacz2vkn2nrqeglvptugyqy54xal2skha6xh0cr7wjueueg79, kaspa:qz9cqmddjppjyth8rngevfs767m5nvm0480nlgs5ve8d6aegv4g9xzu2tgg0u)  
- üü© The "Vault" (now **excluded from attribution** due to only ~26% funding from known Chainge sources, though directly received ~57M Kas from Root wallet in Jan 2024)

We trace wallet inflows up to **4 hops deep**, building a ‚Äútrust graph‚Äù of which wallets are funded (directly or indirectly) by Chainge.

---

### Step 2: Source Attribution by Threshold

For each wallet that sent KAS to a known CEX deposit address, we:
- Analyze its funding history
- Calculate the **% of total inflow originating from Chainge wallets**

Only wallets with **‚â•85% Chainge attribution** are included in the primary analysis. This avoids false positives and ensures we only include wallets likely controlled by Chainge.

---

### Step 3: Identifying CEX Deposits

We match deduplicated `tx_id` entries against a manually verified list of MEXC, Gate.io, and CoinEx deposit wallets. We then aggregate:
- Total KAS deposited per CEX
- Total KAS deposited by all ‚â•85% Chainge-linked wallets

---

## üîç Assumptions & Limitations

- **‚â•85% threshold** avoids attributing mixed-source wallets to Chainge
- **4-hop trace depth** provides adequate reach while keeping the graph computationally manageable
- **Known CEX deposit addresses only** ‚Äî undisclosed CEX wallets are not captured
- **One-directional trace** ‚Äî inflows back from CEXes are not analyzed

The Vault wallet is **excluded from attribution** in the final analysis due to insufficient linkage (only ~26% of its inflow came from Chainge Root or labelled wallets).

---

## üö® API Usage Warning

All transaction data comes from [KrcBot‚Äôs public API](https://krcbot.com/api-docs).  
**Do not re-run the full trace unless absolutely necessary**, as this may overload public infrastructure.

Use the included pre-fetched `.csv` files in `flow_data/` ‚Äî unzip the `.zip` archive to proceed with local analysis.

---

## üìä Key Finding

> üí• **~332 million KAS** was deposited to MEXC and other CEXes by wallets ‚â•85% funded by Chainge Root or known Chainge-linked wallets.

Most of these deposits went to **MEXC**, not Gate.io ‚Äî contradicting earlier assumptions.  
This strongly supports the conclusion that **Chainge Finance liquidated a large portion of its native KAS holdings**.

## ü§ù Contributing & Verification

This repository is designed to be **transparent and reproducible**. You can:
- Propose new wallet tags for Chainge or CEXes
- Tune the attribution threshold
- Fork and run your own analysis
- Compare with other datasets (e.g., @KasperoLabs or @KrcBot)

We welcome peer review and collaboration.
